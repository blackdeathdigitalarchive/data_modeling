# The AirTable table contains fields that represent information about
# documentary evidence in the Turkish archives.  The entries record
# where the evidence is located (what document, etc.); a summary or
# excerpt from the archival document comprising the evidence; and the
# names of places mentioned in the evidence.
#
# Each piece of evidence is a crm:E31 Document.  The places mentioned
# are not E53 Places, because these are mathematical coordinates; they
# are, instead, E92 Spacetime Volumes:
#
# This class comprises 4 dimensional point sets (volumes) in physical
# spacetime (in contrast to mathematical models of it) regardless
# their true geometric forms. They may derive their identity from
# being the extent of a material phenomenon or from being the
# interpretation of an expression defining an extent in
# spacetime. Intersections of instances of E92 Spacetime Volume, E53
# Place and E52 Timespan are also regarded as instances of E92
# Spacetime Volume. An instance of E92 Spacetime Volume is either
# contiguous or composed of a finite number of contiguous subsets. Its
# boundaries may be fuzzy due to the properties of the phenomena it
# derives from or due to the limited precision up to which defining
# expression can be identified with a real extent in spacetime. The
# duration of existence of an instance of E92 Spacetime Volume is its
# projection on time.
